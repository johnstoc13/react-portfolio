## Notes

This Weather Dashboard was built using the Open Weather Map API, jQuery, Bootstrap, Moment JS and Font Awesome. I utilized Moment JS to get my date info for the forecast. Next I used the OpenWeather API to get my weather data. I found the API query to be challenging at first, but once I was able to access the data via the console, I was able to get that data onto the page fairly easily. I pushed myself to stick to jQuery and use template literals. This resulted in much cleaner code and I enjoyed the process. This was a fun and very involved assignment that encompassed the last 6 weeks of the course in its entirety. Using Bootstrap, I was once again able to get a mobile responsive design from the beginning, allowing for a clean and user friendly application.
